# Stores

CoreShop's Stores functionality is a powerful feature that allows you to create and manage a multi-store eCommerce
system within a single installation. This capability is particularly beneficial for businesses looking to cater to
diverse market segments, such as a mix of B2C and B2B customers, or to offer different themes and experiences across
various storefronts.

## Leveraging Multi-Store Capabilities

The multi-store feature in CoreShop leverages Pimcore's Multi Site functionality, enabling you to set up distinct stores
with their own specific configurations, themes, and product selections. This allows for a high degree of customization
and flexibility, enabling businesses to:

- **Target Different Customer Segments**: Create separate stores for different types of customers, such as retail
  consumers and wholesale clients, each with tailored products, pricing, and shopping experiences.
- **Offer Regional Variations**: Manage stores that cater to different geographical regions, each with localized
  content, currency, and payment methods.
- **Customize Themes and Layouts**: Implement distinct themes and layouts for each store, ensuring a unique and branded
  experience that resonates with the specific audience of each store.
- **Streamline Management**: Despite the diversity of stores, manage them all from a single Pimcore installation,
  streamlining operations and maintaining consistency in backend processes.
