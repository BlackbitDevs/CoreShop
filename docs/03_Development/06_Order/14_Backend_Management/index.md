## Key Features of Order Management

The backend management system in CoreShop includes several critical functionalities that enhance the order processing
experience:

- **Order List**: The Order List is a centralized area where you can view and manage all orders. It provides a clear
  overview of order statuses, customer details, and other essential information.

    - **Order List Filters**: Customize your order list view with specific filters to sort and find orders based on
      various criteria such as date, status, customer, etc. This feature allows for efficient order tracking and
      management.
