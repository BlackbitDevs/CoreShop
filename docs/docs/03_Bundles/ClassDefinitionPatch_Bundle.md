#  Class Definition Patch Bundle

The CoreShop Class Definition Patch Bundle provides a convenient way to modify class definitions from other bundles. This is particularly useful for adding new properties to existing classes through a configuration setup.

## Installation
```bash
$ composer require coreshop/class-definitions-patch-bundle:^4.0
```

### Adding required bundles to kernel
You need to enable the bundle inside the kernel.

```php
<?php

// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundlesToCollection(BundleCollection $collection)
{
    $collection->addBundles([
        new \CoreShop\Bundle\ClassDefinitionPatchBundle\CoreShopClassDefinitionPatchBundle(),
    ]);
}
```

## Usage
### Configuration for Patching

To patch a Pimcore class definition, add a configuration like the following:

```yaml
core_shop_class_definition_patch:
    patches:
        CoreShopCompany:
            interface: 'blub'
            fields:
                name2:
                    before: 'addresses'
                    definition:
                        fieldtype: input
                        title: coreshop.company.name2
```

### Patching CoreShop Classes

For patching CoreShop classes, leverage the parameters provided by CoreShop:

```yaml
core_shop_class_definition_patch:
    patches:
        %coreshop.model.order.pimcore_class_name%:
            fields:
                total2:
                    before: 'total'
                    definition:
                        fieldtype: coreShopMoney
                        title: Total 2
```

### Preview Changes

Before applying the changes, preview them using:

```bash
bin/console coreshop:patch:classes --dump
```

### Applying the Patch

Once you're satisfied with the preview, apply the patch:

```bash
bin/console coreshop:patch:classes --force
```

> **Note** that the patch modifies your local definitions, which should be part of your version control (e.g., git repository). After applying the patch, commit these changes. There's no need to run the patch command during deployment.
