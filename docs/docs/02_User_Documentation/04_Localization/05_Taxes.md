# CoreShop Taxes Configuration

In CoreShop, tax rates are crucial for accurately calculating the applicable taxes on products and services. Each tax rate is defined by the following attributes:

- **Localized Name**: The name of the tax rate as it appears in the shopping cart and on invoices. It can be localized to match the language preferences of different regions.
- **Rate**: The percentage value of the tax, such as 20%.
- **Active**: Indicates whether the tax rate is currently active and applicable.
