# CoreShop vs. eCommerce Framework

CoreShop and the eCommerce framework are designed with different ideologies in mind. The eCommerce framework acts as a
skeleton for building eCommerce applications, requiring significant custom development.

CoreShop, in contrast, is a full-featured platform that comes with a rich toolset of optional components. You can choose
to use these components as needed for your eCommerce application. In simpler terms, CoreShop is like an enhanced version
of the framework.

Both systems serve their respective purposes well. The eCommerce Framework is designed to be highly extendable, but it
requires more custom development. CoreShop, on the other hand, offers a plethora of out-of-the-box features, enabling
the quick creation of comprehensive eCommerce systems.
